# LION
This is the implementation of our research paper "LION: Fast and High-Resolution Network Kernel Density Visualization", which is currently accepted in VLDB 2024. Due to space limitations in this Github link, we do not upload the datasets. However, since all datasets are open to public, readers can simply download these datasets from the source webpages (cf. the "Ref." column in Table 3). 

In this Github link, we have uploaded two files, namely "input_file_structure.txt" and "output_file_structure.txt", to show the input file structure of the dataset and the output file structure of the visualization result, respectively. Moreover, we have also provided the shell script file "compile_run.sh" (in the "Code" folder) for showing how to compile and run our code.
